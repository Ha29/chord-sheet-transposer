Use the github page and place your chords here directly from the browser:

# python-music-transciber
basic python script to transcribe music

Needs a myfile.txt as input. 

Within that file, you should seperate chords using the | delimiter. Chords should be together with no spaces, i.e. Bbm7b9

Slash notation will work too but make sure to but the slash at the end of the chord. i.e Bbm7b9/D

Limitations: slash chord notes will show as flat even if the sharp note is more intuitive, i.e. B/Eb will be shown rather than B/D#.
Double sharps and double flats will not work currently. 
Make sure the delimiter | has a space between chords. If you type |C instead of | C you will have an issue. 

Please report any bugs. I'd like to fix it to make sure chords are transcribed properly too! :)
